// Package events is a thin, panic-safe wrapper over the Wails application event
// bus. Backend code emits frontend events through Emit; when no Wails
// application is running (unit tests, headless tools) it is a no-op, so service
// logic stays testable without a live window.
//
// This is hive's replacement for Tauri's app.emit / ipc::Channel: a streaming
// backend operation emits a uniquely-named event per request and the frontend
// subscribes/unsubscribes with Events.On / Events.Off.
//
// A `-tags nowails` build swaps this file for noop.go: the hive-cli links this
// package (through ingestion) but must stay cgo-free, and Wails' Linux backend
// needs cgo. See noop.go for the stub contract.

// listeners. It recovers from any panic raised when no application singleton is

// Sequencer stamps every event on one named stream with a monotonically
// increasing sequence number, wrapped around the payload as a Seq envelope.
//
// Why this exists: Wails v3 (alpha) dispatches each Emit on its own goroutine
// (application.EventProcessor.Emit spawns `go dispatchEventToWindows`), so two
// emits to the same listener race and can reach the frontend out of order. A
// token stream is the worst case — a local model emits many tiny deltas
// back-to-back with no inter-token pause, so a burst of delivery goroutines run
// in scheduler order, not emit order, and the rendered text comes out with its
// characters shuffled. The reordering happens inside Wails after Emit returns,
// so it can't be fixed by serializing the Go call site; instead each per-request
// stream emits through a Sequencer and the frontend (stream() in api.ts) buffers
// by Seq.N and releases a contiguous prefix, restoring emit order.
//
// Use one Sequencer per stream (its counter is per-instance). Broadcast events
// with no ordering requirement (e.g. "feeds-updated") keep using Emit directly.
